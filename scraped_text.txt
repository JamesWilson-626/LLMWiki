Spoiler warning
Cloud Strifeand the members ofAvalanchemake their escape from the headquarters of theShinra Electric Power Companyvia motorbike. Branded "Terrorists" by Shinra News Network, the group is blamed for the appearance of destructive tornadoes that rip through the city ofMidgar, deemed "weather warfare" by Midgar's mayor,Domino.
Elsewhere,Zack Fairtransports a comatose Cloud into theSector 5slums, where he catches the news broadcast and spots his girlfriend,Aerith Gainsborough, unconscious and being wheeled into a helicopter on a stretcher. He entrustsKyrie Canaanwith Cloud's care while he rushes off to save Aerith. Meanwhile,Red XIIIregains consciousness within the helicopter and attacks the crew, causing the helicopter to crash on the outskirts of the sector. There, Zack recovers Aerith and hides her and Cloud atElmyra Gainsborough’shouse.
In the town ofKalm, Cloud tells his friends about him andSephiroth. Five years prior, Cloud was assigned a mission alongside his hero and fellowSOLDIERto investigate monsters that had spawned around theMako reactorin Cloud's hometown ofNibelheim. At theNibel Reactorhalfway upMt. Nibel, Sephiroth finds a room filled with mako-filled pods, supplied via tubes from a sealed room labeled with the name of Sephiroth's mother,Jenova. Sephiroth discovers after a week of research in theShinra Manorbasement the origins of theJenova Project, that he was conceived as an effort to resurrect theAncientsusing cells from a being named Jenova that was excavated from a 2,000-year-old rock layer.
Infuriated and emboldened by the truth of his origins, Sephiroth burns down Nibelheim, killing MayorZander, Cloud's mother,Claudia Strife, andTifa Lockhart’sfather,Brian Lockhart, as he makes his way to the reactor to reunite with his "Mother." Outraged at the loss of her family and home, Tifa attempts to kill Sephiroth with his own sword, but Sephiroth instead mortally wounds Tifa. Cloud confronts Sephiroth about the loss of his town, his mother, and Tifa, but the outcome of their confrontation is unknown.
Cloud's story leaves the group with many questions, including how Sephiroth could still be around despite the news reporting on his death. Tifa in particular notices many inconsistencies with Cloud's story, but before she can discuss them with Cloud, Sephiroth appears before Cloud, mentioning that according to Cloud's memories, Tifa should be dead. When Cloud accuses Tifa of being an imposter, Tifa is hurt by Cloud's lack of trust, providing him with proof that her survival is the truth by showing her healed scar.
The next morning, the group explores the town of Kalm before Shinra sends in an air raid to locate the Avalanche fugitives. With the help of innkeeperBroden, they flee Kalm and head into theGrasslands Area. They rent aChocobofromChoco Billto help them cross the swamplands, but are ambushed by theMidgardsormr. Despite defeating the giant serpent, it constricts Cloud and drags him underwater in an attempt to drown him. Sephiroth comes to Cloud's aid, killing the serpent by impaling it on a tree.
The fugitives find a group ofhooded men, who Cloud insists are following Sephiroth. They follow the men into theMythril Mines.

Development
Final Fantasy VII Rebirthbegan development following the completion ofRemakeand its development overlapped with the third game.[2]
A Launch date trailer was shown during the September 2023 Playstation State of Play, after which Creative Director Tetsuya Nomura confirmed that the game would cover the events of the originalFinal Fantasy VIIup to and including theForgotten Capital, though the order of the events would be changed as well. Nomura also confirmed the presence of AI-controlled party members akin to Red XIII during the later half ofRemake.[3]
In the third trailer, it was announced that the song for this game is “No Promises to Keep” performed by Loren Allred, and that at one point in the game at the Gold Saucer, Aerith sings it on stage.
Reception
Reception
LeBlanc 2024
Final Fantasy VII Rebirthreceived overwhelmingly positive reviews. With an aggregate of 93% onMetacriticafter 119 reviews,[5]it has the highest score of aFinal Fantasygame sinceFinal Fantasy IX, and the first single player entry to reach over 90% sinceFinal Fantasy XII. Critics praised it for its improvements overFinal Fantasy VII Remakeacross the broad, citing its combat system and character-driven stories as its strengths. It received some criticism for its ending, and for pacing with minigames.
Much praise was given to the combat, which critics praised as an elevation overRemake. Iain Harris ofGamesRadar+highlighted the Synergy abilities as the main evolution of the core combat, noting that they give more reason to swap characters midway.[7]Jenni Lada ofSiliconeraconcurred that more reason was given to switch party members, and noted that each had a distinct role.[9]Michael Higham, writing forIGN, argued that though the amount of moves the game offers can at times be overwhelming, it offers an "embarrassment of riches without making you too overpowered when it really counts".[10]
Another highlight was the character-driven stories inRebirth. Tamoor Hussain, writing forGameSpot, found this to be the "soul ofRebirth's narrative and frequently exhibit excellent character work".[8]Lada praised the interactions between the characters, saying that Square Enix has stayed faithful to their original character, meaning new plotlines involving them never felt forced.[9]Harris noted how the sidequests with other party members "rewards you with greater intimacy with your own party, as a companion always takes an interest in what's happening and is keen to help".[7]
Critics mostly praised the side content, but felt that they at times hurt pace. Writing forNME, Andy Brown called the side content and minigames "exceptional" and felt the wealth of them "make the world feel truly alive".[11]Harris noted their inclusion was faithful to the originalFinal Fantasy VII, meaning the game "maintains the joy of going through a toy box".[7]Conversely, Hussain, while noting enjoying the minigames, argued that the side-content in between the main narrative harmed the pacing of the story, finding it "hard not to get irked when the gang is playing carnival games, frolicking around in beachwear, or racing chocobo for hours on end while the fate of the world hangs in the balance".[8]
Though critics enjoyed the character-driven parts of the story, disappointment was expressed regarding the ending. Higham believed that the game does "fumble the execution" of the ending due to being "caught up in the mess of its multiple twisting timelines".[10]Hussain agreed, saying that Aerith was robbed a moment crucial to her character as "the message is lost among narrative noise".[8]Harris agreed the convoluted story elements carried over as an issue fromRemake, but argued thatRebirthhad improved on the story padding issue, finding it "less noticeable and more enjoyable this time around".[7]
